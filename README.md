# LightningLogin.Live - A LNURL-auth Demo

This is a simple demo site to showcase how damn cool it is to log in with Lightning. ⚡

The main purpose is to spread awareness and let people know that this exists and not only works, but works really well already. This whole project was inspired by [stacker.news](https://stacker.news/), so shout-out to [@huumn](https://github.com/huumn). Also shout-out to [@fiatjaf](https://github.com/fiatjaf) for his work on LNURL and for curating the [awesome-lnurl](https://github.com/fiatjaf/awesome-lnurl) list.

### Live Demo

Try out the site on [LightningLogin.Live](https://lightninglogin.live/)

### Buttons

Button assets are to be found in the [lightning-buttons](https://github.com/seetee-io/lightning-buttons) repository.

### Should I Use This?

Well, maybe. Maybe not. You should probably look into [nostr](https://nostr.com/).

### Nostr?

Yes, nostr. [NIP-07](https://nostr-nips.com/nip-07) in particular.
